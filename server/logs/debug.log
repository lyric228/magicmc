		"1.10.0":"Ported to 1.20.1, depends on flib-0.0.7+ . Fixed patchouli book.  Port to new non-deprecated curios datapack tags.  Includes pull requests merged into the 1.18 and 1.19 branches :  Merge pull request #492 from IIpragmaII/trunk/1.18 @IIpragmaII @VasurTrekkson Improved performance for export node.  fix priority german translation @lightlike .   Fixed recipes not showing when pressing the JEI recipe key @Demerso.   Create uk_ua.json @SKZGx   "
		,"1.10.1":" Merge pull request #518 from ALFEECLARE:  add ja_jp translation."
		,"1.11.0":"  Fix the bug when using small window sizes where the top row of player inventory items getting inserted instead of picked up when using the remote when jei is installed.  Merge pull request #536 from maxpowa : Add support for EMI mod; this also fixes crash #513.   "

	  	,"1.11.1":"The Storage Request Table 'storagenetwork:request' block no longer saves the contents of its crafting-grid; instead items are returned to the player on close, exactly matching vanilla crafting table behavior  (this was changed to prevent potential exploits. If any items are left behind in the grid during world upgrade they will be returned and not lost. No changes were made to the remotes or to other blocks). Fixed a null pointer exception "

		,"1.11.2":"Ported the Cable Facades feature (from Minecraft 1.12.2), so that you can shift-left-click with a block on a cable to hide it with a facade.  Disable this feature or ignore certain blocks with the config file"
		,"1.11.3":"Fixed item tooltips not rendering in Storage Remote.  Fixed visual rendering and text errors inside of import/export cables using the 'operation upgrade'"
		,"1.12.0":"Added a new Expanded Request Table and the Expanded Remote to support GUI Scale 2 or larger for players on large monitors/resolutions.  Internal refactoring for Import and Export cable capabilities: item transactions are now executed inside the cable tile-entities instead of the main node tile-entity (meaning the main root node is doing less processing work, and also the network overall should have fewer wasted cycles).  "
		,"1.12.1": "Fix JEI/EMI recipe autocomplete"
